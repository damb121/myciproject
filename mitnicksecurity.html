                        <p>Social engineering is an extremely effective technique used by hackers worldwide to compromise internal systems and proprietary information assets. In fact, it’s one of the top two hacking techniques used by criminals to compromise organizations like yours. 
                            With the use of savviness and Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) from social media or other publicly-accessible websites, malicious “social engineers” weave a convincing pretext via phone, email or in person— all with the goal of fooling members of your team into trusting them.</p>
