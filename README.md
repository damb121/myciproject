# The Worlds Most Wanted Hacker

Thie project is intended to demonstrate skills learned from HTML/CSS course material. It is based upon project idea -Example 1 historical facts surrounding a particular artefact, person, place or event.

I have choesen well known hacker(but maybe not to everyone) Kevin Mitnick.

## Features 


### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - The Nav bar features on all pages and contains similar techniques learned in the love running project. 


- __The landing page image__

  - The landing page includes a photo of Kevins arrest warrant with another image while he was on the run. The thought here is to grab the viewers attention and take advantage of the recent cultural obsession of true crime. If I had used a more boring picture of Kevin (behind a computer) the user would not be as interested to learn more. 

  I used the transform zoom technique that was used in the love running project as I found it worked quite well with this image.

  There is also text containing a famous quote from Kevin.



- __Kevin Mitnick-The Hacker __

  This section at high level(without having to read the full biography) shows how Kevin became famous for his crimes but also what hes done since and his success.

### Features Left to Implement

- would like to add a timeline element to the biography page that shows milestones throughout Kevins career.
- add a media section page as there a whole host of hacking demos available online from Kevin over the years as well as talks.


## Testing 
The navigation works as intendened using techniques I have learned in the love running site. 

The responsiveness of the content on smaller devices can be improved. Splitting out the images and text with more Divs etc would make the adjustment much easier. For future work I will continously check the different device sizes as the site is built out. I found leaving this to the end difficult and improving it would require redoing a lot of the site.

A lot time was wasted on the sizing positioning of the demo video. In future it would help to jot out the different pages and content before hand. 

The validation sites should also have been used earlier as I found both very useful but at the end of the project.

### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - 1 warning , 0 errors
- CSS
  - 0 errors 

### Unfixed Bugs

The responsiveness of the content on smaller devices can be improved. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
